We are coming into a challenging time where privacy is becoming far more important to individuals. The current state requires encrypted data to be decrypted in order to for computations to be performed on the data. This opens the data to exposure by the organization performing the computation which isn't always desired. There have been efforts made to tokenize any private information but it has been deemed as ineffective to protect disclosure.   
There may be a solution on the horizon with Homomorphic encryption. It would allow for data that is encrypted to remain protected while being used for other purposes. Several of the proposed use cases are medical related. Imagine medical records where partial information disclosure is permitted to specific individuals or where [protecting genome identity](http://www.humangenomeprivacy.org/2018/) is necessary while maintaining security.  
Solving this privacy problem will help provide new capabilities for users. It could be extended to allow individuals allow disclosure to trusted entities. The part of revoking access is why we have things like GPDR and the right to be forgotten.
